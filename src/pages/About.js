            Welcome to MusicalArts! We are a company solely focused on selling
            Christian artwork and music of all types. Here we believe that both
            the combination of great art and music go well together and serve as
            great works for glorifying God’s work through us.

            We wanted to create a platform where artists and musicians of faith
            can sell their works to believers. We also believe that this will
            benefit the non-believer as well and would be a blessing that would
            help them understand who God is.

          <i>
            In a world where dark art and music are promoted and have become the
            norm in our world’s cultures, we want to disrupt that by providing a
            specialized e-commerce platform that promotes the opposite. We
            believe that this will help promote creative believers and would
            help shift culture to seek and promote God’s Kingdom on Earth as it
            is in Heaven.
